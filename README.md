### Todo
- how good is support for markdown notebooks as docs
- how do we setup code references something like Pydantic Settings - Pydantic this also means we have to add more code documentation - that @jjmachan will also pitch in 
- search, need a fast search bar to find stuff
- theming -> make black theme, consistent with ragas docs
- what are the other cool stuff in material for mkdocs can we use to make our documentation the best in the world. This is a where you can use your expertise and creativity, just a list of possible items is enough
